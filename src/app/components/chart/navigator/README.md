# Navigator
The navigator draws a small preview version of a Plot Base that has some interactive behavior to enable the selection of an x-axis value bound.

The navigator integrates with the chart as a component that, when an x-axis value bound is selected, will cause the chart to redraw with the new x-axis value bound.
