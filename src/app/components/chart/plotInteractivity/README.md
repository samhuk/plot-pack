# Plot Interactivity

This module overlays a drawn Plot Base, showing the following:
* Horizontal and/or vertical lines at where the cursor is at over the plot base
* Snapping to the nearest datum to the cursor position
* Highlighting the snapped datum(s) with a configurable datum highlight
* A tooltip that summarises the snapped datum(s)
